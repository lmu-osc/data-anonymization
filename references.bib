               entails a series of legal requirements for development and
               design, for the default settings, and for the employment of
               computer architectures. In addition, the chapter defines the
               right to privacy as a subjective right, attributed by objective
               law, which may be national (constitutional) law, international
               human rights law, or supranational law (EU fundamental rights
               law). The chapter first confronts the landscape of human rights
               law at the global, national, and EU level. It then inquires into
               the right of privacy, as guaranteed under the ECHR and the
               Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (CFREU), and
               finally provides an extensive analysis of the new fundamental
               right to data protection, as guaranteed by the CFREU and
               protected by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).",
