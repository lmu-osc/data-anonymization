    "text": "Privacy by Design (PbD) as a Guiding Principle\nPbD, originally developed by former privacy commissioner Dr. Ann Cavoukian, outlines measures that technologists can use to ensure privacy is architected and software is designed with privacy in mind from the start.\nPbD is goverened by several principles that have an impact on the research setting, which are outlined below.\n\nProactive and Preventative Approach: PbD mandates that researchers and data architects anticipate and prevent privacy invasive events before they occur. For example, in the context of health care research, this means ensuring the integrity of patient data is secured from the moment it is collected.\nPrivacy as the Default: Systems must be designed so that the maximum degree of privacy is delivered automatically. If a researcher or data subject takes no action, their privacy must remain intact at the maximum level.\nBalancing Utility and Privacy: PbD supports the objective of having full functionality—positive-sum, not zero-sum. Hence, privacy is not a feature that can be “sacrificed” for a greater benefit. This is critical in research, where the goal is to produce data of sufficient quality that the analytics are useful and meaningful. Instead, the goal is to find sweet spot between information and privacy—enabling enough data utility for the purpose it was collected while preserving privacy for the individuals."

Datensparsamkeit pushes the data collector to consider to think about the mimimum amount of data that is needed to get the job done. Reducing the amount of stored data can also reduce the treat of the data storage to become target of a privacy attack."

    "text": "Federated learning and distributed data analysis. Data privacy in a pipeline\nFederated learning is a set of data processing techniques that preserve privacy by allowing for local and distributed processing of data. For example, instead of being required to move the data to a foreign server or cloud for processing, federated learning allows processing on-site, on premised or on the local device. In a second step, only (anonymous) summary results are collected later. Federate learning techniques are often the only option to process very sensitive, such as health data that are not permitted to leave protective hospital environments or firewalls.\nFederated learning and distributed data analysis needs to be planned in advance. This is because the algorithms for federate analysis are different from those that would be run on the entire data set, and because they need to be tested for data shift or data drift, hence that processing the data locally and then aggregating does lead to the same results as running the algorithm on the entire data set."

    "text": "What is the GDPR?\nThe GDPR The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), in German Datenschutz-Grundverordnung (DSGVO) is a legal framework for the protection of person-centric data within the European Union. The The regulation was finalized in 2016 and came into force in 2018 and applies to all companies that process data of EU citizens, regardless of the company’s location. (p. 221, Jarmul 2023).\n\n\nThe GDPR in brief\nAll laws and articles of the GDPR can be found online: https://gdpr-info.eu/.\nThe GDPR guarantees 8 fundamental rights for people residing in the EU, and for their data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Right\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nRight to be informed\nPeople must be informed on how their data is being used, processed, collected, and so forth.\n\n\nRight to access\nPeople can access what information is held about them.\n\n\nRight to rectification\nPeople can correct information that is false or misleading.\n\n\nRight to deletion/erasure\nPeople can ensure companies delete their data.\n\n\nRight to restrict processing\nPeople can opt out or restrict how their data is being used and processed.\n\n\nRight to data portability\nPeople can take their data with them—to use themselves or to try competitor services.\n\n\nRight to object\nPeople can object to the usage of their data for particular uses (like marketing, research).\n\n\nRight to opt out of automated decision making\nPeople can opt out of automated decision making processes, such as algorithmic or machine learning systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat does the GDPR regulate?\n\nthe protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and rules relating to the free movement of personal data.\nfundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons and in particular their right to the protection of personal data.\nthe free movement of personal data within the Union shall be neither restricted nor prohibited for reasons connected with the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data.\n\nThe GDPR is based directly on EU law (Article 16 TFEU) and replaced the older Data Protection Directive (1995). Unlike a directive, which requires member states to implement it in their national laws, the GDPR is a ‘Regulation’, meaning it applies directly throughout the entire EU. This also means that all EU countries must not provide less data protection and privacy than laid out within the GDPR. (Hildrebrant, 136).\n\n\nWhen does the GDPR apply?\n\nwhen personal data is being processed (art 2)\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions in the GDPR\nBelow are some definitions that the GDPR operates on. Click on the arrow to the right to expand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotePersonal data\n\n\n\n\n\nis any information connected to a person who can be identified, either directly (for example, by their name or ID number) or indirectly (for example, through location, online accounts, or details about their body, health, finances, culture, or social life).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteProcessing\n\n\n\n\n\nmeans doing anything with personal data, whether by hand or with a computer. This includes things like collecting, recording, organizing, storing, changing, looking up, using, sharing, combining, limiting, deleting, or destroying the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteController\n\n\n\n\n\nController means the person, company, public authority, or organization that decides why personal data is processed and how it is processed. In some cases, the law itself decides who the controller is or sets rules for how the controller is chosen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteProcessor\n\n\n\n\n\nProcessor means the person, company, or organization that processes personal data on behalf of the controller. They follow the controller’s instructions and don’t decide the purpose or the means of the processing themselves.\n\n\n\nIt is important to know that these rights apply to all EU residents, whether the are currently in the EU or not.\n\n\nPrinciples of lawful processing\nTo ensure the lawful processing of personal data, organizations, particularly data controllers, must adhere to a set of fundamental principles, as outlined prominently in Article 5 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). These principles serve as overarching requirements that must be met in addition to having a valid legal basis for processing.\nThe seven core principles of lawful processing under the GDPR are:\n\nLawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency ((Hildebrandt2020?)):\n\n\nLawfulness requires that all processing operations have a valid legal basis, as exhaustively listed in Article 6 of the GDPR (see legal basis)\nFairness implies balancing and proportionality tests, considering the relevant interests and fundamental rights at stake.\nTransparency necessitates providing clear and accessible information to data subjects, for instance, through privacy notices, and is further detailed in Articles 13, 14, and 15 GDPR. It ensures that data subjects can predict how their data will be handled and what outcomes to expect.\n\n\nPurpose Limitation:\n\n\nPersonal data must be “collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes”. Vague or broad goals, such as “data might become useful” or “for commercial goals,” are prohibited.\nFurther processing for a new purpose is permissible if it is “not incompatible” with the original purpose. Factors for determining compatibility include the link between purposes, collection context, data nature/sensitivity, potential consequences for the data subject, and the existence of safeguards like encryption or pseudonymization.\nNotably, further processing for archiving in the public interest, scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes is explicitly deemed compatible with the initial purposes, provided suitable safeguards are in place.\n\n\nData Minimization:\n\n\nData collected must be “adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed”\n\n\nAccuracy\n\n\nPersonal data must be accurate, and when necessary, kept up to date.\nControllers are legally obliged to take every reasonable step to ensure that inaccurate personal data is erased or rectified without delay, especially concerning the purposes for which it is processed.\n\n\nStorage Limitation\n\n\nPersonal data must be “kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed”.\nThis also prevents keeping the data for longer than necessary for “just in case”.\n\n\nIntegrity and Confidentiality\n\n\nPersonal data must be “processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures”.\nThe GDPR mandates “appropriate” security, not “perfect” security. This principle connects directly to the requirement of security by design (Article 32 GDPR) and the obligation for controllers to notify supervisory authorities and data subjects in case of data breaches (Articles 33 and 34 GDPR). Pseudonymization and encryption are examples of security measures that can be implemented.\n\n\nAccountability\n\n\n“The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with” all the aforementioned principles.\nThis principle makes the data controller the focal point of responsibility and liability under the GDPR. It requires controllers to maintain records of processing activities, and in some cases, to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO). The accountability principle underscores a proactive approach to compliance, moving beyond merely reactive measures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportantData collection.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you\nThis content is inside a collapsible tip box.\n\nItem 1\nItem 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegration with other legal frameworks\nTo date, an overarching international framework for anonymisation does not exist - it would also be quite hard to find a common group between varying legal frameworks.\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topReferences\n\nJarmul, Katharine. 2023.

This definition is a cornerstone of privacy regulations, particularly the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and extends far beyond obvious identifiers.\nAn individual is considered identifiable if they can be recognized, either directly or indirectly, through various identifiers or factors. These identifiers can include:\n\nDirect identifiers. These are information that can directly point out and identify an individual, such as address, social security number, bank accounts, or an email address.\nIndirect or quasi identifiers. These are data that can, when combined with other pieces of data, lead to the identification of an individual. Examples include date of birth, age, gender, geographic location (like a ZIP or postal code), marital status, or details about events (e.g., admission dates, procedure codes).\n\nThe assessment of whether a person is identifiable takes into account all means reasonably likely to be used by either the data controller or another person to identify the natural person, including methods like “singling out”. This “reasonably likely” criterion considers objective factors such as the costs, time, effort, and available technological means at the time of processing and potential future technological developments. For instance, a dynamic IP address can qualify as personal data if it can be linked to a specific person, even if that linking capability resides with an Internet Service Provider and requires a court order (see also legal case Breyer v. Germany).",

    "text": "K-anonymity\nDefinition and Initial Purpose K-anonymity was developed by computer scientist Latanya Sweeney following her demonstration of how she could re-identify supposedly anonymized medical records released by the State of Massachusetts. By linking public medical records with voter registration records using quasi-identifiers like age, zip code, and gender, she was able to single out individuals, including the governor’s medical records (p 54, Jarmul (2023)). The principle of k-anonymity attempts to mitigate such linkage attacks by ensuring that in any released dataset, each record is indistinguishable from at least k-1 other records concerning a set of “quasi-identifiers” (attributes that, when combined, can uniquely identify an individual). This means grouping people with similar sensitive attributes, and not releasing groups that have fewer than k people.\nAn example of K-anonnymity is given below.\nLet’s generate some fake data:\n\ndata &lt;- data.frame(\n  age = c(34, 35, 36, 36, 36, 40, 40, 41, 42, 42),\n  gender = c(\"M\", \"M\", \"M\", \"F\", \"F\", \"M\", \"F\", \"F\", \"M\", \"M\"),\n  zipcode = c(\"12345\", \"12345\", \"12345\", \"12345\", \"12345\", \"67890\", \"67890\", \"67890\", \"67890\", \"67890\"),\n  diagnosis = c(\"Flu\", \"Cold\", \"Flu\", \"Cold\", \"Allergy\", \"HIV\", \"HIV\", \"Flu\", \"Cold\", \"Allergy\")\n)\n\n\n\n\nRaw data example\n\n\nage\ngender\nzipcode\ndiagnosis\n\n\n\n\n34\nM\n12345\nFlu\n\n\n35\nM\n12345\nCold\n\n\n36\nM\n12345\nFlu\n\n\n36\nF\n12345\nCold\n\n\n36\nF\n12345\nAllergy\n\n\n40\nM\n67890\nHIV\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to topDifferential privacy (Optional sub-topic - short & collapsable)\n\nJarmul, Katharine. 2023.

    "text": "Nullifing\nNullifing, or Nulling Out, is a simple method of the family of data masking teqchniques in which a column of sensitive values is replaced by the null value (Raghunathan 2013). This method is useful, but only for a limited set of cases. For example, nullifying is only possible for columns for which the values are nullable. (note: find example of non-nullable column).\nA variation of Nullifing is the Character Replacement Technique or Character Masking, in which the value is replaced by a character different than null (such as spaces, ’ ‘, ’Y’ or ‘N’). One example application of this technique could be replacing the very sensitive column “Previous Criminal Conviction” in a spreadsheet with “N” for all subjects once all yes entries (“Y”) have been carried over into a more secure data base. Another example is the replacement of credit card number values with XXX. In the credit card example, the application of teh character masking technique can be partial, hence only the first 9 numbers are replaced. Further, the overall number of characters stays the same, hence: XXXX XXXX XXXX 1234.\nA further variation is Conditional Nullifing, which means replacing data entries with zero based on a condition. For example entries in a column “Customer Feedback” could be nullified if the customer feedback was negative (Raghunathan 2013).",

    "text": "What is data Pseudonymisation?\nPseudonymization (rec.28)[https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-28/] is a process by which “original data are replaced with false data”. It is characterized by “the use of a false name” or other replacement values instead of real, direct identifiers. The most critical distinction is that pseudonymized data is still personal information. The EU GDPR explicitly states that “personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person” (https://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/recital-26-GDPR.htm). Hence, pseudonymized data is still personal data, and has to be treated as such.\nPseudonymized data “can be traced back to original data value” because “indirect identifiers that remain in pseudonymized data are known to pose a potential re-identification risk”. This re-identification often occurs via linkage attacks, where seemingly innocuous indirect identifiers (like age, ZIP code, and gender) are combined with external information to identify individuals.\nThe GDPR considers peudonymisation as a first step towards reducing re-identificaton.",

The hospital keeps a separate file that links codes to real identities.\n\n\n\n\n\nPseudonymised — because the re-identification key still exists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario 2: City Council Survey\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipThe council publishes aggregated statistics on recycling behavior, showing how many households recycle per neighborhood. No individual household identifiers are included.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnonymised — the data is aggregated, no individuals can be singled out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario 3: Fitness Tracker Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipA company shares running and sleep data with researchers, with usernames replaced by random IDs. However, the dataset still contains exact GPS routes of daily runs.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot clear — technically pseudonymised, but GPS traces might allow re-identification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario 4: University Exam Scores\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipExam results are shared with teachers identified only by student number. The university has the key to look up the names behind the numbers.\n\n\n\n\n\nPseudonymised — student number acts as a pseudonym with a key in the system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario 5: Online Store Reviews\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\n\nNot clear — identifiers are removed, but free text may reveal identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario 6: Traffic Accident Database\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipA dataset on accidents contains driver age, car model, and exact location + time of each accident. Names and license plates are removed, and no key is kept.\n\n\n\n\n\nNot clear / borderline anonymised — no key exists, but rare event details may still re-identify.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScenario 7: Genetic Study\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTipDNA sequences are stored with no names but are coded with lab IDs.
